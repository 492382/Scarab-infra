dss is Darwin Streaming Server
httpd is Apache HTTP Server

trace_dss.sh and trace_httpd.sh collect traces for dss and httpd
  respectively (they are just temporary and will be added to run_scarab.sh)

dss/Dockerfile is used for building the image for dss
http/Dockerfile is used for building the image for http

Dockerfile.scarab contains the steps for building DynamoRIO and Scarab
  included in dss/Dockerfile and http/Dockerfile
  (and will be replaced by common/Dockerfile.common in both)
